                A crate gives your dog somewhere to retreat if they're tired or they want to 'escape' for a bit if they don't want to be bothered.

            <h2>Travelling</h2>

            <p>
                A crate that’s suitable for travel can make travelling with a dog easier

                A crate is safe for your dog when you're unable to supervise them. It can prevent them from eating harmful things or getting into trouble.

                You should enjoy the security of your dog. He has the ability to recharge in his crate and come out as his friendly and happy self when he is ready.
