                    A crate gives your dog somewhere to retreat if they're tired or they want to 'escape' for a bit if
                    they don't want to be bothered.

                    A crate that’s suitable for travel can make travelling with a dog easier

                <p>
                    A crate is safe for your dog when you're unable to supervise them. It can prevent them from eating
                    harmful things or getting into trouble.

                <h3>Dogs love Crates</h3>

                <p>
                    You should enjoy the security of your dog. He has the ability to recharge in his crate and come out
                    as his friendly and happy self when he is ready.

                <h3>How to crate train</h3>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose the Right Crate for Your Dog</li>
                <p>
                    there are three main types of crates to choose from – metal, plastic and fabric. What you choose
                    depends on your puppy’s preferences and the primary purpose of the crate. If you often travel in the
                    car with your puppy, for example, you’ll probably want something quite lightweight but safe.It’s
                    important, she notes, that you don’t buy a crate that is too big for your dog.It needs to be large
                    enough for your dog to stand up in, turn around and lie down comfortably.

                </p>
                <li> Let your dog explore the crate</li>
                <p>
                    You want to make sure the door is open and should never force your dog into the crate. It’s fine to
                    gently encourage exploration and treats can come in handy here. Never force your pet into the crate
                    as this can cause negative relations to it.

                </p>
                <li>Build up the time your dog is in the crate</li>
                <p>
                    Once your puppy is starting to get accustomed to their crate, you will want to start slowly building
                    up the amount of time they’re in there. A good way of doing this is to feed them in their crate.Once
                    you think that your puppy is getting used to being in their crate, you can start shutting the door.
                    It’s important you take this very gradually, only shutting the door for the briefest amount of time
                    at first and opening it again if your puppy shows any signs of wanting to get out.

                </p>
                <li>Leaving your dog in the crate</li>
                <p>
                    Your dog needs time outside the crate to play, eat, and use the bathroom. Dogs don’t want to soil
                    where they sleep, but if there’s too long of a stretch without a walk, they might end up doing so.
                    Once your dog get accustomed and feels safe in their crate start increasing there time in small
                    steps. Remember Adult dogs shouldn't be left in crates for more than 6-8 hours. Puppies of 17 weeks
                    and older can handle up to 4 or 5 hours in a crate at a time.
