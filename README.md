Why is Crate training important?
1. Step 1: Choose the Right Crate for Your Dog
there are three main types of crates to choose from – metal, plastic and fabric. What you choose depends on your puppy’s preferences and the primary purpose of the crate. If you often travel in the car with your puppy, for example, you’ll probably want something quite lightweight but safe.It’s important, she notes, that you don’t buy a crate that is too big for your dog.It needs to be large enough for your dog to stand up in, turn around and lie down comfortably.
2. Step 2: Let your dog explore the crate
You want to make sure the door is open and should never force your dog into the crate. It’s fine to gently encourage exploration and treats can come in handy here. Never force your pet into the crate as this can cause negative relations to it. 
3. Step 3: Build up the time your dog is in the crate
Once your puppy is starting to get accustomed to their crate, you will want to start slowly building up the amount of time they’re in there. A good way of doing this is to feed them in their crate.Once you think that your puppy is getting used to being in their crate, you can start shutting the door. It’s important you take this very gradually, only shutting the door for the briefest amount of time at first and opening it again if your puppy shows any signs of wanting to get out.

4. Step 4: Leaving your dog in the crate
Your dog needs time outside the crate to play, eat, and use the bathroom. Dogs don’t want to soil where they sleep, but if there’s too long of a stretch without a walk, they might end up doing so. Once your dog get accustomed and feels safe in their crate start increasing there time in small steps. Remember Adult dogs shouldn't be left in crates for more than 6-8 hours. Puppies of 17 weeks and older can handle up to 4 or 5 hours in a crate at a time.
